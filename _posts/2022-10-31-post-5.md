I almost exclusively develop using SSH sessions on other CUDA-enabled machine for differentiable rendering, PyTorch, training models, etc.  Recently, I ran into the problem off having the VS Code server failing to start at the beginning of an ssh session.  This [post on SO ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67976875/vs-code-remote-ssh-the-vscode-server-failed-to-start-ssh) showed how to kill the server remotely so that it will restart on the next login attempt.
